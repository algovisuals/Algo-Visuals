## Implemented Algorithms

### Arrays

- **Quick Sort:** Visualize the divide-and-conquer strategy with pivot selection and partitioning
- _Coming Soon:_ Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, Binary Search, Selection Sort, and more

### Graphs

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Visualize finding the shortest paths in a weighted graph
- _Coming Soon:_ BFS, DFS, and more graph algorithms

_Additional algorithm categories (Trees, Linked Lists, Heaps, Dynamic Programming) are under development_
