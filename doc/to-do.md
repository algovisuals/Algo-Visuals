### Week 1: Project Foundation & Arrays Foundations

**Objective:** Establish a robust Next.js project structure and a unified design system.

**Objective 2:** Complete the initial arrays page with major features completed.

- **Technical Implementation:**
  - [ ] Refactor and organize the existing codebase (routing, file structure, etc.).
  - [ ] Fully set up Next.js dynamic routing and Tailwind CSS for responsive, consistent styling.
  - [ ] Create reusable components to be used for the arrays algorithms
- **Learning Components:**
  - [ ] Familiarize with Next.js fundamentals and Tailwind CSS patterns.
  - [ ] Get used to using D3.js.
- **Outcome:** A clean, scalable foundation that supports smooth feature integration in subsequent sprints.

### Week 2: Arrays implementation

**Objective:** Start implementation of all other arrays algorithms

- **Technical Implementation:**
  - Creation of the other pages, specifically the following other algorithms.
    - Merge Sort (this may be more complicated with merging visualization)
    - Bubble Sort
    - Selection Sort
    - Binary Search
    - Linear Search
